Explanation:
app/: This is the main application directory where all your Python modules and templates are stored.
app/templates/: This directory contains all your HTML templates.
app/static/: This directory is for static files such as CSS, JavaScript, and images.
tests/: This directory is for all your test scripts and test data. It's good practice to keep your tests separate from your application code.
Dockerfile: This file contains the instructions to build your Docker image.
docker-compose.yml: This file is used by Docker Compose to define and manage multi-container Docker applications.
requirements.txt: This file lists all the Python dependencies required by your project, which can be installed using pip.
README.md: This file contains documentation for your project. It's good practice to document how to set up the development environment, how to run the tests, and how to deploy the application.
Docker Setup:
Your Docker setup will depend on your specific requirements, but at a high level:

Dockerfile: Create a Dockerfile in the root of your project to define how to build your Docker image. This will include instructions for setting up the Python environment, installing dependencies, and starting your application.
docker-compose.yml: Create a docker-compose.yml file to define your services, networks, and volumes. This will allow you to easily manage and run your Docker containers.
